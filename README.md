# 🚚 Truck Fleet Risk Analysis & Visualization

Welcome to the **Truck Fleet Risk Analysis & Visualization** project-a deep dive into real-world trucking data for smarter fleet management and risk reduction!

---

## 🚦 Project Overview

As the fleet manager of **AZ National Trucking**, the biggest challenge was clear: **reduce insurance risks by addressing unsafe driving practices** across a large, nationwide fleet. From speeding and unsafe following distances to lane departures, every risk factor directly impacts operational costs and safety.

**Key Objectives:**

* Identify dangerous drivers with a risk threshold above 7
* Pinpoint high-risk truck models across the nation
* Map violations by geographic location
* Understand how trucks, drivers, and location contribute to overall fleet risk

---

## 📦 Dataset

The analysis is powered by **7 comprehensive data files**, including:

* Truck profiles
* Truck mileage records
* Geolocation and trip data
* Driver information
  ...and more

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills

* **Big Data Tools:** Cloudera Hadoop, HDFS, Apache Spark, Sqoop
* **Query Engines:** Impala, Hive, HiveQL
* **Visualization:** Tableau (via JDBC connections to HDFS)
* **Others:** SQL, Data Wrangling, Data Modeling

---

## 🔍 What I Did

* **Processed and analyzed large-scale fleet data** using Spark, Impala, and Hive on the Hadoop cluster.
* **Integrated HDFS with Tableau** using JDBC drivers for interactive data exploration.
* **Built 15+ live dashboards** to visualize critical metrics-mileage, gas usage, risk scores, violations-enabling real-time identification of high-risk drivers and trucks.
* **Uncovered actionable insights**: Mapped violation hotspots, identified hazardous truck models, and provided granular visibility into driver risk-helping inform targeted safety programs.

## 💡 Impact

This project empowers fleet managers to:

* **Spot high-risk drivers and trucks in real-time**
* **Take data-driven action to improve safety**
* **Reduce insurance and operational costs**
* **Visualize trends and compliance at a national scale**
